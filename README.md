## All about my project:
My project is about different types of sports leagues. There you will find various information of different leagues.

>Key features of this project:

1. On this website you can find out when the leagues were formed, which country's league, what kind of sport, etc.
2. I have added pictures and logos of the leagues so that you can easily identify the leagues.
3. Social media links of the leagues have been added to the website.


**Note:**
I have dynamically displayed the league badge/logo on the dynamics banner on the details page using CSS position property. I modified the theme color and name of the website as was the requirement of the assignment. Thank you.# react-router-Ahaduzzaman01
